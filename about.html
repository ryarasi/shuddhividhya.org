          >Shuddhi Trust</a
        >, aspires to transform the way education is conducted. We wish to
        reform how education is perceived and how it is approached across the
        country. We want to make education engaging, meaningful and practical to
        everyone undergoing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shuddhi Vidhya is at the very early stages in its movement towards these
        goals. We currently partner with rural schools to teach Computer
        Programming and Web Development to underprivileged children for free. We
        use project-based learning, independent learning and self-paced learning
        among other novel pedagogical methods to teach personally meaningful and
        financially empowering skills to those who need it the most. And we are
        constantly looking for ways to do it in a manner that is most engaging
        to kids.
      </p>

      <p>
        We encourage kids to focus on learning to learn, rather than memorizing
        facts. We then offer them a way to exhibit their learning through
        creative projects that are independently designed and executed by them.
        This method of doing things keeps it engaging for them and gives them
        creative control to express themselves through their learning, while
        also enhancing their employability prospects.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe doing this at a large scale is essential to open the world up
        to the vast populations of eager young minds that are yet to have fair
        opportunities to express themselves fully to the world.
